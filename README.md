# Oxide.Ext.CarbonAliases

The "CarbonAliases" Oxide Extension for RUST Servers is a powerful tool designed to seamlessly integrate plugins originally developed for the Carbon Engine into Oxide server environments.
This extension facilitates the cross-platform compatibility of plugins, allowing them to be used on both Carbon and Oxide servers with ease.

Primarily designed for the high-performance Carbon Engine, the plugins experience significant performance enhancements within the Carbon environment.
However, when deployed on Oxide servers, these plugins seamlessly adapt to function as regular Oxide plugins, without incorporating the specific performance optimizations of the Carbon engine.

The core functionality of the "CarbonAliases" extension lies in the creation of aliases for authentic Carbon functions within the Oxide environment.
This innovative approach enables a smooth transition between Carbon and Oxide, ensuring that plugins written for Carbon maintain their functionality and compatibility when utilized on Oxide servers.

In summary, the "CarbonAliases" Oxide Extension acts as a bridge between Carbon and Oxide, allowing server administrators and developers to harness the strengths of both platforms while ensuring a consistent and reliable experience for plugin deployment across diverse RUST server environments.

Moreover, the "CarbonAliases" Oxide Extension is an open-source project, encouraging collaboration and community involvement.
If users find the need for additional functionality, such as the creation of more aliases for specific Carbon functions, they are welcome to contribute by committing updates to the project.
This open and collaborative approach ensures that the extension remains dynamic and responsive to the evolving needs of the RUST server community, fostering a shared space for innovation and improvement in the integration of Carbon Engine plugins with Oxide servers. Contributors can actively participate in enhancing the extension's capabilities, making it a valuable resource for server administrators and developers seeking a versatile solution for plugin compatibility across different server environments.

It's important to note that the "CarbonAliases" Oxide Extension may experience a halt in updates in the event of a comprehensive overhaul of Carbon Engine that renders the extension obsolete or unnecessary for most servers.
The project anticipates that as the Carbon Engine undergoes significant changes, the need for maintaining the extension may diminish, and updates may no longer be actively pursued.
