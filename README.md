# Oxide.Ext.CarbonAliases

The "CarbonAliases" Oxide Extension for RUST Servers is a powerful tool designed to seamlessly integrate plugins originally developed for the Carbon Engine into Oxide server environments.
This extension facilitates the cross-platform compatibility of plugins, allowing them to be used on both Carbon and Oxide servers with ease.

Primarily designed for the high-performance Carbon Engine, the plugins experience significant performance enhancements within the Carbon environment.
However, when deployed on Oxide servers, these plugins seamlessly adapt to function as regular Oxide plugins, without incorporating the specific performance optimizations of the Carbon engine.

The core functionality of the "CarbonAliases" extension lies in the creation of aliases for authentic Carbon functions within the Oxide environment.
This innovative approach enables a smooth transition between Carbon and Oxide, ensuring that plugins written for Carbon maintain their functionality and compatibility when utilized on Oxide servers.

In summary, the "CarbonAliases" Oxide Extension acts as a bridge between Carbon and Oxide, allowing server administrators and developers to harness the strengths of both platforms while ensuring a consistent and reliable experience for plugin deployment across diverse RUST server environments.
